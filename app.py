    ### How to Use This Tool
    
    1. **College Predictor Tab**:
       - Enter your TS EAMCET rank, gender, caste, and preferred branch
       - Select which phase data you want to use (Final is recommended for accuracy)
       - Optionally filter by district to find colleges in specific areas
       - Click "Predict Colleges" to see your eligible options
                
    2 **College-wise Branches Tab**:
       - View all branches and their cutoffs for a specific college
       - Compare the difficulty level of different branches within the same institution
       - See the list of top 20 colleges based on market trends
    
    3. **College Search by Branch Tab**:
       - Enter your desired branch, caste, and gender to find colleges offering that branch
       - Use the 'N/A' option for caste to see closing ranks across all categories
       - View additional details like fees, place, and district for each college
    
    4. **Phase Comparison Tab**:
       - Compare how college cutoffs change across different counseling phases
       - This helps you understand if waiting for later rounds might improve your options
    
    5. **Branch Analysis Tab**:
       - Analyze which branches have higher or lower cutoff ranks
       - Useful for exploring alternative branches if your desired one is too competitive

    ### Understanding the Results
    
    - **Closing Rank**: The last rank that got admission in that college/branch in 2024
    - **Your eligibility**: If your rank is equal to or better (lower number) than the closing rank, you likely qualify
    
    ### Important Notes
    
    - This tool uses historical data from TS EAMCET 2024
    - Actual 2025 cutoffs may vary based on seat availability, number of applicants, etc.
    - Always verify information with official TS EAMCET counseling notifications
    - Special category seats (sports, PH, CAP, etc.) have different cutoffs not reflected here
